An ultra-light-weight web framework

Why _another_ one?
==================

Often the best way to appreciate your tools is to try to do without them.

Just like several other projects, this is my effort to better understand the
tools I use.

Philosophy
==========

A framework should protect you from two things:

1. dangerous things
2. tedious things

Requirements
============

- Python 3
- A WSGI publisher (like gunicorn, uwsgi, Apache/mod_wsgi)
